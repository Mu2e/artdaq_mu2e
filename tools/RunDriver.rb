# This script is meant to provide a very simple example of how one
# might control an artdaq-based program from the command line. The
# idea is that this script uses its command line arguments to generate
# a FHiCL document which in turn is passed to the mu2e-artdaq's
# "driver" program for processing.

# DemoControl.rb, the main script used to run the full teststand
# simulation, operates off of essentially the same principle -- i.e.,
# use command line arguments to configure a FHiCL script which is in
# turn sent to executables for configuration and processing

# Here, we simply create a FHiCL script designed to run the new
# "ToyDump" module so as to print ADC values from fragments of type
# TOY1 or TOY2 to screen (see the mu2e-artdaq/Overlays/ToyFragment.hh
# file for more, and/or look at the online Wiki,
# cdcvs.fnal.gov/redmine/projects/mu2e-artdaq/wiki

require File.join( File.dirname(__FILE__), 'generateToy' )

# A common way to de-facto forward declare functions in Ruby (as is
# the case here with generateToy) is to bundle the main program flow
# into a function (here called "main" in honor of C/C++) and call the
# function at the end of the file

def main

  # More sophisticated programs also use the "OptionParser" class for
  # command line processing
